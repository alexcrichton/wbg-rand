# wbg-rand

Implementation of `rand` for wasm32-unknown-unknown in Rust using
`#[wasm_bindgen]`.

## Usage

First add a dependency to your Cargo.toml:

```toml
# Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
wbg-rand = "0.4"
```

Next add the following to your crate:

```rust
extern crate wbg_rand;

use wbg_rand::{Rng, wasm_rng};
```

The `rand` crate is reexported from the `wbg-rand` crate so the `Rng` trait here
is the [same as it is upstream](https://docs.rs/rand/0.4.2/rand/trait.Rng.html).

And now you use `wasm_rng` just like you would `thread_rng`!

# Example Usages
See the [Rng](https://docs.rs/rand/0.4.2/rand/trait.Rng.html) trait for more documentation.

```rust
use wbg_rand::{Rng, wasm_rng, math_random_rng};

// get random boolean, `math_random_rng()` samples `Math.random` in JS every call
let a: bool = math_random_rng().gen();
println!("{}", a);

// `wasm_rng()` only samples `Math.random` to re-seed periodically
let n = wasm_rng().gen::<f64>();
println!("{}", n);

let r: usize = wasm_rng().gen_range(0, 10);
println!("{}", r);
```
